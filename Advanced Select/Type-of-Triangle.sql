Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths.
Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:
Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
